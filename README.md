This repository contains a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.  The function includes a check to handle empty lists correctly.  However, it lacks a check to ensure that the input list contains only numeric values and throws a TypeError if the input list contains non-numeric elements such as strings.  The bugSolution.py file provides a solution for handling the case when a list contains non-numeric elements.
